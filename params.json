This led many to turn to communism for a change in leadership, leaving many with high hopes for a brighter future. Because of the confusion and turmoil that ensued following the exit of several communist leaders, Stalin’s entry was unopposed following Lenin’s death. He then implemented ‘Stalin’s Five Year Plan’, which was designed to industrialize Russia and uplift the suffering economy. Stalin, through national confusion, a state sponsored, controlled industrial revolution, false promises of better times, and political deviousness and dishonesty, came to power and used his totalitarian government to force ideals and ways of life on Russians and put Russia as a whole in a state of confusion and turmoil.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe first couple decades of the 1900s were a time of change for Russia, but much of this change was through mass uprising and therefore there were times of confusion in between governments and leaders.  This is the time when Joseph Stalin chose to make his move into the dictatorship of Russia.  Stalin began his slow climb of the party ladder as early as 1912 when he was appointed to the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party by Lenin in his exile, five years before the Russian Revolution and the Bolsheviks seized power.  In 1922 he became secretary general of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, his last step before making the leap to the dictatorship.  Just seven years after the end of the Russian Revolution, the Soviet Union’s (adjective) leader Vladimir Lenin died after only two years in office.  Amid the confusion, Stalin managed to win power struggle for control of the Soviet Union, and by the late 1920s was putting the first of his three Five Year Plans into effect.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nTo keep the support of the Russian citizens, Stalin initiated a propaganda campaign and made many promises to the people. Stalin used many different types of propaganda: radio, newspapers, posters, art, theater, and public meetings. Radios were one of the main ways for citizens to get information of what’s going on around them. They were placed in strategic public areas that citizens would have to come to, so that the people could receive the propaganda broadcasts. Newspapers were also used in the same manner that radios were. Posters were spread widely around the country in order to lionize and heroize Stalin. Even the art and theater at the time was used as propaganda. Much of the art was full of health, and happiness, and busy industrial and agricultural scenes. The theater was used to encourage the citizens to support the regime and spark an even deeper hatred for Russia’s enemies. Many images of the government defending the poor peasants and attacking the enemies. Public meetings were also very popular. Large meetings would be set up with speakers that would give the propaganda to the people. The people thought they were being cared for and given up to date news by the government, but it was really only another propaganda tactic. Stalin’s effective use of these many kinds of propaganda solidified his leadership in Russia.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAs Karl Marx’s theory had stated that communism needed a strong industrial backbone, Stalin convinced Russia of the need for extreme industrialization in the late 1920’s and early 1930’s.  His Five Year Plan also needed rapid industrialization on a humongous scale, and so it gave unreasonably high goals for production to excite the people.  With Russians needing more food and peasant farms not providing enough, Stalin proposed collectivization, where small farms join together into a large collective farm to maximize efficiency.  When there was a famine and everybody had been ignoring his ideas altogether two years later, Stalin required collectivization by law.  Angry at this idea, peasants purposefully killed their animals and burned their crops, instead of giving them to the government willingly as Stalin wanted.  After another famine, another attempt from Stalin at forced collectivization, and another famine, Stalin declared war on the kulaks (farms owned by wealthy peasants).  In the end, food production rose, but the peasants were controlled mostly by the government, and millions were killed.  Although Stalin did achieve his goal of industrialization and better production, it came with enormous losses.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nROSS STUFF - NEED SOON!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nStalin used the Totalitarian government to monitor the public and emphasize patriotism. Writers and artists were to use “socialist realism”, which asked that all work portray reality in Russia as the party demanded in a form that the average worker would be able to understand. The majority of the work created portrayed the people of Russia barely overcoming obstacles and defeating enemies in order to positively display the Soviet Union. Although the work was not accurate, and did not accurately portray Russia at the time, it led many to believe that Russia was strong and successful. This helped Stalin to remain in power. Stalin also created a secret police force that monitored foreign communist parties and those living in Russia. This was designed to ensure that the public remained pro-Soviet and pro-Stalin. Citizens were encouraged to turn in those who they believed were violating Stalin’s principals, and the members of this organization were authorized to arrest those who openly disagreed with Stalin. The police force created helped Stalin to strengthen the Soviet Union and further impose state pride. Together, the police force and the implementation of socialist realism led Stalin to remain in power.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThese factors all aided Stalin in remaining in power, giving him absolute control in Russia. Stalin, through national confusion, a state sponsored, controlled industrial revolution, false promises of better times, and political deviousness and dishonesty, came to power and used his totalitarian government to force ideals and ways of life on Russians and put Russia as a whole in a state of confusion and turmoil.
